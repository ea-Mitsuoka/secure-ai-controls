# Skill: Requirements Definition

## Purpose
Produce a requirements definition document that states what must be built and why —
derived from the goal rather than from existing artifacts, objective, and complete enough
that design and acceptance testing proceed without re-asking.

## Inputs
- The goal: the problem to solve and who has it, from a human or an issue. If it is absent
  or ambiguous enough that two reasonable implementations would diverge, drive it out by
  interrogation (Process step 2) — do not fill the gap with an assumption (CLAUDE.md §13).
- The success definition: how the requester will judge the result as met.
- The template: [docs/foundation/templates/requirements.md](../docs/foundation/templates/requirements.md) —
  structure and required sections.
- Scope boundaries: [.ai/mission.md](../.ai/mission.md). Read other existing docs and code
  only in Process step 4, not before.

## Process
1. **Fix the purpose.** Write the objective in one sentence and the success metrics
   (measurable) before anything else. Every requirement downstream traces back to these.
2. **Interrogate the open decisions, one fork at a time.** Before deriving the full set,
   drive out every unresolved decision through conversation — not a form, not a bulk list
   of questions. Take one fork at a time (scope boundary, who the users are, data owned,
   constraints, the success threshold, the risky edge cases), hardest and most-divergent
   forks first. For each, state your own recommended answer as a draft for the human to
   correct, not a blank question — reviewing a draft is faster and surfaces disagreement
   sooner. Answer factual questions yourself by reading the codebase (what already exists,
   what constrains you) instead of asking them; but do not source requirements from
   existing solutions — that is step 5's reconciliation and would reintroduce bias.
   Continue until no fork material to the purpose is left open.
3. **Derive requirements zero-based.** From the purpose and the decisions resolved in
   step 2, enumerate the requirements they demand. Do not let prior solutions shape the
   ideal set (bias). Capture the ideal set first.
4. **Trace each requirement to a purpose or success metric.** A requirement that traces to
   none is a deletion candidate, not a given.
5. **Reconcile with reality.** Now weigh existing assets, constraints, and platform limits
   against the ideal set; filter and adjust. Record where a constraint forces a deviation
   and why.
6. **Assign IDs and priority.** Stable IDs (FR-00x functional, NFR-00x non-functional) and
   a MoSCoW priority with a one-line basis per requirement.
7. **Fill the template top to bottom.** Define terms, assumptions, and constraints once in
   their sections; reference them by name afterward (DOC-002). Do not restate a definition.
   After template instantiation, write the completed project document in Japanese and
   translate the template headings and table labels. Use another language only when the
   repository owner or an external contract explicitly requires it (ADR-0005).
8. **Complete the non-functional set** against the ISO/IEC 25010 characteristics that
   apply, and give each NFR a measurement method — a target with no way to verify it is
   not a requirement.
9. **Estimate infrastructure cost with assumptions stated** (region, unit prices and their
   date/source, assumed traffic/volume): fixed + usage-based, plus the increment when
   scaled. A number without its assumptions is not usable.
10. **Separate decided from undecided.** Move open items to the Open questions section; do
    not blend decided requirements with unresolved ones.
11. **Self-review** against the checklist below and `.ai/review-checklist.md`; open a
    `docs:` PR (or fold into the initiating feature PR).

## Decision criteria
- **How to interrogate (step 2).** One decision at a time, each carrying your recommended
  draft answer, hardest/most-divergent forks first. Prefer resolving a fork over listing
  many open questions. Anything still unresolved after interrogation goes to the Open
  questions section (step 10), never into a silent assumption.
- **Functional vs non-functional?** A behavior the system performs → FR. A property of how
  it performs (speed, availability, security, usability, observability) → NFR.
- **In or out of scope?** If it does not trace to the purpose, default it to non-scope and
  state it there explicitly. The non-scope list prevents the most rework.
- **Priority (MoSCoW).** Must = the purpose fails without it. Should / Could = ranked by
  contribution to a success metric. Won't = recorded and deferred, not dropped silently.
- **Requirement or design?** State what must hold and why, not how to build it. A
  requirement that names a specific technology needs a recorded reason; otherwise move the
  solution detail to design.
- **Escalate** on the CLAUDE.md §13 triggers (authentication, payments, PII schema, data
  deletion, production config) before finalizing requirements that touch them.

## Outputs
- A completed document from the template at `docs/requirements.md` (whole project) or
  `docs/requirements/<initiative>.md` (one initiative).
- In an instantiated repository, the completed project document is written in Japanese,
  including headings and table labels, unless an explicit language exception applies.
- Every FR/NFR carries a unique ID, a priority, and a traced purpose.
- Open questions listed separately; any §13 escalations raised.
